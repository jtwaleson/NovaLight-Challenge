# The NovaLight Challenge



We stand on the shoulders of giants. One of these giants is Peter K. Joneleit. You may not have heard of him, but then again, no one had heard of Chuck Norris until five years ago.

Let me tell you something about Peter K. Joneleit. This man was so clear-sighted it was uncanny. Ever heard of something like css transformations? He invented those. You kids are playing around with stuff like transitions, but that all came out of his head. He was a web-interaction visionary.

In the nineties neither machines nor humans were ready for his ideas. The machines lacked the power, humans were playing around with the &amp;*##!@ <i>blink</i> element. (Peter, if you are reading this, I am so sorry for what you had to go through!).

So, what could Peter do to prevent him from going insane? His solution is so inspiring, it brings tears to my eyes: he created a <b>program</b> of his vision for the web and put it into a time capsule for all to see.&nbsp;<a href="http://novalight.net/NOVALIGHT.html">http://novalight.net/NOVALIGHT.html</a>&nbsp;His silent message to humanity: "Wake me up when you guys have caught up!"

We have come quite a long way in these 12 years and web browsers are some of the leanest and meanest programs ever. CSS3 and HTML5 are certainly steps in the right direction, although there is still some work to be done.

Peter K. Joneleit, it's time to wake up. Over the last couple of weeks I have spent day and night exploring all the neat features of your vision, like rotating stars, hovering on every element, loading fonts, multiple background layers, moving images (though not gifs!). Your visionary program is available here:ically created the ACID3 test for HTML5/CSS3. Once these could mimic your program, the web could do anything.
